simple quiz app

Application Description:

This application is a simple quiz program where users can log in and answer questions from various categories. At the beginning, the program asks the user for a login name. The username must be at least 3 characters long; if the user enters 2 characters or fewer, the program will prompt them to enter the username again.

Once a valid username is entered, the application greets the user and provides a brief explanation about how the program works. For example, when the username is entered correctly, the screen may display:

"KAAN, WE CAN START RIGHT NOW! YOU NEED TO CHOOSE A CATEGORY"


This message informs the user that they can now start the quiz and need to select a category. There are three different categories in the program:

Mathematics – Contains basic math questions.

Physics – Contains simple physics questions.

General Knowledge – Covers general knowledge topics.

When the user selects a category, a question from that category appears, and the user is asked to provide an answer. If the answer is correct, the user is congratulated and directed to select a new category again; if the answer is incorrect, the user is informed and can try again or choose a different category.

This setup allows the user to:

Log in with a personal username,

Solve questions based on their selected category,

Continue interacting with new questions or categories after giving correct answers.

The purpose of the program is to entertain users while answering questions and also to demonstrate the use of basic Python concepts such as functions, loops, and dictionaries through a simple login and category selection system.
